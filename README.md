### Project Description  
NoCart is a grocery shopping web app that does nothing productive. You can add groceries to a metaphorical cart, search for items and receive AI-generated excuses, and experience a checkout system that proudly fails. It's pointlessly beautiful.

---

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
What if people wanted to *feel* like they were grocery shopping but not actually do anything useful?

---

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
A useless e-commerce site where the cart is temporary, the search is full of nonsense, and checkout is just a witty letdown. Built to frustrate with flair.
