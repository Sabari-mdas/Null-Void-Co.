NoCart.exe - The Useless Grocery Shopping App 🍌
Welcome to NoCart.exe, the grocery shopping app that guarantees you’ll never get what you want! Brought to you by Null and Void Co, this app is a masterpiece of futility, designed to waste your time with a tacky pastel pink interface and pointless features. Why shop for groceries when you can get a list of socks and clouds instead?
Why Bother?
NoCart.exe is the ultimate anti-shopping experience. It’s perfect for those who love typing grocery lists only to be mocked with responses like “Looking for vegetables? Here’s some random junk instead: socks, paperclips, clouds.” Built with the same useless spirit as Null and Void Co’s finest creations, it’s a shining beacon of absurdity.
Features
Useless Search Bar: Type a grocery item (e.g., "milk") and get a completely irrelevant list of items (e.g., "rubber duck, spoon, glitter"). Powered by keyword-linked nonsense.
Fake Order Button: Click "Order Now" to see it flash "Nope!" and pop up a message saying, “This button does nothing!” Because, obviously.
Random Notifications: Annoying pop-ups every 5–20 seconds with gems like “Online shopping is not good for health.” or “Don’t order anything. Seriously.”
Tacky Aesthetic: Comic Sans MS font and a pastel pink background that screams “I’m trying too hard to be useless.”
Zero Groceries: No actual shopping or delivery. Just pure, unadulterated pointlessness.

Requirements:

Python 3.x (with Tkinter, included in standard Python installations).
A sense of humor or a high tolerance for nonsense.
No actual need for groceries—hunger is optional.

Installation
Why would you install this? But if you insist:

Clone the repository (if it existed): git clone https://github.com/nullandvoidco/nocart.git
Save the NoCart.py file locally.
Ensure Python 3.x is installed (python3 --version).
Run the app: python3 NoCart.py.
Optionally, create an executable with PyInstaller: pyinstaller --onefile NoCart.py (creates NoCart.exe).
Prepare to question your life choices.

No dependencies beyond Tkinter, because usefulness is overrated.
Usage

Run NoCart.py or NoCart.exe.
Type a grocery-related query in the search bar (e.g., "vegetables," "where’s milk") and press Enter.
Enjoy a useless response like “Searching for vegetables? Try these useless gadgets instead: broken phone, empty battery, fake goldfish.”
Click the "Order Now" button to watch it mock you with a “Nope!” animation and a pop-up.
Wait for random notifications (e.g., “Online shopping is not good for health.”) to interrupt you. Close them to feel briefly productive.
Repeat until you give up.

Screenshots
Imagine a pastel pink window with Comic Sans text and a button that does nothing. No screenshot needed—it’s that pointless.

Contributing
Contributing to NoCart.exe is like adding glitter to a landfill. If you must:

Known Issues:

The app works perfectly at being useless.
No banana background (yet), just pastel pink. Want bananas? Host an image and patch the code.
Notifications may cause mild annoyance or existential dread.

Future Plans:

Add a fake checkout page that crashes when you try to pay.
Include a “Track Delivery” button that points to Narnia.
Maybe add a spinning avocado that doesn’t spin.

Contact
Don’t bother. But if you must, shout into the void at @NullAndVoidCo. Expect a reply like “Error 404: Help not found.”

Crafted with zero purpose by Null and Void Co. Enjoy the nothingness!
